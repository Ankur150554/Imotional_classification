## Project Overview

Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is the process of identifying the emotional state of a speaker from their voice [web:41]. This project implements a robust SER system capable of classifying emotions from audio inputs. The core of this project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on features extracted from audio signals, such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) [web:41][web:44]. The model is designed to be efficient and can be deployed for real-time analysis in applications like customer feedback analysis, mental health monitoring, or enhancing human-computer interaction [web:48].

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Emotion Detection**: Classifies emotions from microphone input with minimal latency.
- **File-Based Analysis**: Upload and process `.wav` audio files to get emotion predictions [web:47].
- **High Accuracy Model**: Achieves an F1-score of **[Your F1-Score, e.g., 80%]** on the test set, effectively distinguishing between **[Number]** distinct emotions.
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilizes industry-standard audio features including MFCC, Chroma, and Mel spectrograms for robust performance [web:44].
- **Data-Driven**: Trained on a combination of popular datasets like **RAVDESS** and **TESS** to ensure generalizability [web:39][web:40].



## Methodology & Model Architecture

The project follows a standard machine learning pipeline:

1.  **Data Preprocessing**: Audio files are loaded, normalized, and augmented to create a balanced and robust dataset.
2.  **Feature Extraction**: Librosa is used to extract key features like MFCCs, which capture the unique characteristics of the voice tied to emotion [web:41].
3.  **Model Training**: A `[Your Model, e.g., CNN or RNN-LSTM]` model was built using TensorFlow/Keras. The architecture consists of:
    -   **[Number]** Convolutional layers to identify local features from the audio spectrograms.
    -   **[Number]** Max-pooling layers for down-sampling.
    -   A **Flatten** layer followed by **[Number]** Dense (fully connected) layers for classification.
    -   **Dropout** layers are used to prevent overfitting.
4.  **Evaluation**: The model was evaluated using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score on a held-out test set.

## Future Improvements

This project provides a solid foundation for speech emotion analysis. Future work could include:

- **Multimodal Analysis**: Integrating facial emotion recognition from video to improve accuracy [web:42].
- **Deployment**: Packaging the model into a REST API and deploying it on a cloud service like AWS or Heroku.
- **Advanced Models**: Experimenting with Transformer-based models for potentially higher accuracy.
